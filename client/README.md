# Client side

This folder mainly contains the `.scss` files as well as static `.js` files which are not required for server-render.

The stylesheets subdirectory follow the same skeletal structure as that of the `shared` folder.


## index.js

the `index.js` file is pretty straight-forward. It is responsible to retrieve the `__INITIAL_STATE__` sent from the server and attach it to the DOM.
